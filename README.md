The Student Progress Report Project is a Python-based application designed to manage and display student academic performance efficiently.
This project helps in storing student details, entering subject marks, calculating total marks, percentage, and determining grades.
The system reduces manual work and avoids calculation errors by automating the progress report generation process. It is easy to use and suitable for schools and colleges to track student performance.
The project is developed using Python and follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) concepts, making the code structured, reusable, and easy to understand.
